# Q3-LocalCliffordEquivalent
LocalCliffordEquivalent is a Wolfram Mathematica application to help study local Clifford equivalence for stabilizer states. Stabilizer state is a state that can be uniquely defined with stabilizer subgorup of the Pauli group that stabilizes the state.
## Requirement
LocalCliffordEquivalent requires Mathematica v13.0 or later and [Q3](https://github.com/quantum-mob/Q3).
## Installation
follow the below instrument step by step :
1. Install Q3 by following [Installation Guide](https://github.com/quantum-mob/Q3/blob/main/INSTALL.md) of [Q3](https://github.com/quantum-mob/Q3).
2. Launch Mathematica and activate "$UserBaseDirectory" and copy the link.
3. Open the link and click "Applications".
4. Paste "LocalCliffordEquivalent.wl" there.
## Guide
Open "LocalCliffordEquivalentGuide.nb" to get detailed technical information about the application. It will give you guides and tutorials.
## Reference
This code is based on the below papers :
